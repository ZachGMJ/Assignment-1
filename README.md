Image 1: I am happy with the way the buttons are layed out across the bottom of the would be interface. They are simple and easy to understand buttons for users. However, I left a lot of room for the notifications and nothing else takes up that space. Perhaps I should have something else there.

Image 2: This design is more based on having one page to deal with instead of buttons to take you to more pages. The time selector is fully out in the open where you can set a consistent time for the medicine to dispense, and oc ourse there is an eject button to reload the medicine. Also, instead of a large notification window popping up, it is just a banner which I think works much better.
